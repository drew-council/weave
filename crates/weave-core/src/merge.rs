//! The merge's front door, its result types, and the machinery around the
//! decision itself.
//!
//! The decision itself lives in [`crate::v2`]: match, classify, plan, resolve,
//! render. [`entity_merge_fmt`] is the entry point every
//! caller uses, and its job is to hand v2 three texts and a marker format and
//! then get out of the way.
//!
//! What is left here is everything around that decision, and it falls into
//! three groups:
//!
//!   1. **The pre-checks that can refuse before v2 runs at all** — binary
//!      content, a file over 1MB, inputs that already carry conflict markers.
//!   2. **Helpers v2 calls into** — interstitial and import merging, decorator
//!      handling, container wrapper extraction, the scoped marker writer. These
//!      predate v2 and were kept because v2 needed exactly them; each is reached
//!      from `v2::mod`, `v2::resolve`, `statement` or `container`.
//!   3. **The line-level route** — [`line_level_fallback`] and what it calls
//!      (`skip_expansion`, `expand_separators`, `git_merge_file`, `diffy_fallback`).
//!      Reached only after v2 returns a typed `Unsupported` verdict, or on the
//!      size and binary pre-checks above. Nothing on this route produces an
//!      audit trail, so a fallback merge reports bytes and no per-entity story.
//!
//! There is no fourth group. A helper here that no live path reaches is a bug,
//! not history.

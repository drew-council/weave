//! Rendering: a fold over the plan. It decides nothing.
//!
//! v1's reconstruction chased predecessor chains, tracked which entities had
//! already been emitted, special-cased blank lines per entity shape, and then
//! ran `post_merge_cleanup` over the result to delete the duplicate lines it
//! had just produced. Every one of those was a consequence of placement being
//! decided *during* emission.
//!
//! Here placement is already decided, and every entity appears in the plan
//! exactly once (it came from a triple, and every entity is in exactly one
//! triple), so the fold emits each once and needs no clean-up pass afterwards.
//! `is_clean` likewise stops scanning the output for `<<<<<<<`: conflict status
//! is read from the dispositions.
//!
//! The interstitials get the same treatment as the entities: `extract_regions`
//! already tiles the file, so the merged gaps and the merged entities together
//! ARE the file. The fold emits each gap verbatim, exactly once, in front of
//! the entity it leads.
//!
//! That is a change of policy from "read the file's dominant blank-line
//! convention and apply it everywhere". That uniform convention was
//! byte-lossy whenever a file does not have a single dominant convention: a
//! file that separates some declarations by one blank line and some by two
//! has no single convention, and
//! rewriting it to one is a diff the merge invented. A synthesised separator is
//! now what happens only where an insertion creates a boundary that never
//! existed in any version, which is the only place there is nothing to preserve.
